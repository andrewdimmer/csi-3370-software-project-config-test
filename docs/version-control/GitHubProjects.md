# Version Control Documentation - GitHub Projects: The Sprint Task Status Board

[<-- Return to Version Control Documentation Hub](README.md)

When we've talked about creating issues and pull requests in the past, we've always had a step to set the project and the milestone. But what are they, and how do we use them? Below, we'll go over all of this!

## What are "GitHub Projects"?

A GitHub Project is simply a visualize issues, pull requests, and notes into swimlanes. This allows us to easily make things like a Sprint Task Status Board (STSB), or a bug triage board. Because these boards are also tied directly to the issues and pull requests themselves, they can be configured with basic automation to move issues and pull requests from one swimlane to another each time their status changes.

## How do I view a project like the Sprint Task Status Board?

1. Open the repository at GitHub.com.

2. Click on the "Projects" tab in the menu bar directly below the repository name.

3. Select the project board you want to see from the list.

You can also use the "Open" and "Closed" toggle to switch between viewing open and closed project boards.

## How to I move issues and pull requests from one status to another?

Thanks to GitHub's automation rules, you really shouldn't need to! Each issue and pull request will move itself to the correct status based on the status of that issue or pull request itself.

In the off chance that you do need to manually move something though, you can do so by simply clicking and dragging.

## What is a "Milestone"?

A milestone is just an arbitrary collection of issues and pull requests that represents typically something like a feature release. In this case, we'll be using them to track where we need to be by the end of each sprint (i.e. what code needs to be done before our next demo).

## "I'm trying to find an Issue or PR on a GitHub Project Board. How can I filter and search for it?"

From within a project board, you can simply click on different attributes to filter by it. These include but are not limited to:

- Clicking on your team's label to see everything assigned to your team
- Clicking on a milestone to see everything that needs to be done by that deadline
- Clicking on yourself to see everything assigned to you

You can also search and filter using the filter bar in the top, right-hand corner of the project board.
