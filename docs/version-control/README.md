# Version Control Documentation - Hub

## Why is contributing this repository so complex?

Whenever working on production code in industry, one of the main goals is to not break it for other people working on it. This is done by isolating changes to different Git branches, then enforcing code reviews and testing before merging.

While this project is not an industry project by any means, we also have almost 50 developers working on it at once, on a really short timeline to get everything done before the end of the semester. Nobody wants to spend their time trying to figure out why the project won't build anymore, just to find out that one person on another team accidently blocked the whole thing from building (we're also programming from the command line, so let's be real, this is a real possibility).

Therefore, just like industry automates checks and puts processes in place to keep production services up and running, we'll do the same.

What about things like issues, projects, milestones, and labels? While these don't protect the project, they serve to increase transparency as to what other teams are working on, and reduce the amount of manual paperwork everyone does.

By tracking each of the Product Backlog Items (PBIs) as issues, we can automatically generate the Sprint Task Status Board (STSB), and automatically keep it up to date via GitHub projects. This replaces the need for us to download an Excel STSB from Moodle, add our updates, then reupload it before the next person makes another change. Milestones allow us to track goals against the sprint deadlines, and automatically generate a release to demo to the professor at the end of each sprint. And final labels and naming conventions allow us to manage what teams are working on what when, and who is responsible for what parts of the project at a glance.

## This sounds hard! How can I learn what to do?

Never fear, while it may sound like a lot, it shouldn't be that much more work. And the goal here is to use systems so that you only need to spend a little time keeping things up to date, instead of a ton of time fixing stuff when it breaks.

With all that in mind, there should be clear documentation on how to do everything you need to do, as well as video tutorials for doing most of it!

For ease of readability, all of this content has been split into different sections, so you can quickly find what you need.

1. [Writing Code and Pull Requests (PRs)](WritingCode.md)

2. [Code Reviews (CRs)](CodeReviews.md)

3. [Issues: Bug Reports and Feature Requests](Issues.md)

4. [GitHub Projects: The Sprint Task Status Board](GitHubProjects.md)
