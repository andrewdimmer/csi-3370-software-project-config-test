## Getting the Code to my Computer

1. To download the code to your computer, you must first install a git client. In most cases, if you are new to GitHub and Git, it's easiest to start with [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). You can also use the git CLI (Mac and Linux), git bash (windows), or [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) (for more advanced GUI features).

2. "Clone" this repository from your prefered git client to whatever directory you are going to work out of.
