This repo contains the work of 5 independant sprint teams. To streamline the work follow, increase automation and transparency, and decrease friction between teams, this repo is configured to protect the `main` line to prevent breaking other teams.

For more information, and trainings, check out the [version-control](version-control/) docs.
