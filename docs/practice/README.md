# GitHub Practice

The purpose of this exercise is to help you get familiar with Git, GitHub, and the workflow we'll be using to manage the project.

## For Team SCRUM Masters

Team leads will create a sprint item for their team. The user story will be "[TEAM_NAME] Complete GitHub Practice", and they will have an item called "Complete my GitHub Practice" assigned out to each team member. Be sure to use the appropriate labels, projects, milestones, and assignees!

## For each person

### Open an issue

Each team member will open up a bug for their programming pair partner. The bug title will be "[TEAM_NAME] @GitHubUsername Practice Using GitHub". Make sure to add the appropriate labels, projects, milestones, and assignee!

### Add some code

1. Clone the repo to your computer.
2. Add the code from "JUnit-5.6.2_Monograph_01_Writing_Our_First_Test_ClassFolder" to the `edu.oakland.practice.[TEAM_NAME].[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]` package. Note: This code will not build/meet the style guides without modification; that's ok! That's part of the practice!
3. Commit your code, and open a pull request draft with the correct title, issue references, labels, assignees, etc.
4. Make code changes and commit them until you pass the automated build tests.
5. Add your programming pair partner as a reviewer, then mark the draft as "Ready for Review".
6. Once they review it, merge and you're all set with the programming.
7. Double check that your bug is closed, then check off your task on the use story.

### Add a code review

When your partner is ready for you to give you a code review:

1. Open up your partner's pull request (It's helpful to use the filter by Reviews and selecting "Awaiting reviews from you").
2. Give it a code review! Some things to check include that the referenced issues, title, labels, project, milestones, etc. as well as the code itself!
3. If you have any changes to recommend, add them in the code review, and mark it as "Request changes". Otherwise, feel free to approve it! Be sure to add a comment as well!
