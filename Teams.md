# Teams

This document shall explain the team structure defined by the professor that guides this group project.

> "Each SCRUM Team participates in the Case Study & Root Cause Analysis. All are supervised by the _Project Scrum Team_. The SCRUM Teams, 1 through 4 have been assigned to specific subsystems: _Display 1, Display 2 , Middleware 1, Middleware2, & Database 1, Database 2_. Teams have been split into 2 parts due to the Class Projectâ€™s complexity. These Subsystems conform to the _classical 3-layer closed architecture_. That is, Display knows only about Middleware, and Middleware only knows about Database. Only Display can issue requests to Middleware in response to requests from an External Actor. Only Middleware can issue requests to Database. Database can only respond to requests from Middleware."
